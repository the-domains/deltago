**_Welcome to Deltago_**

Where change happens.

For leaders, growers, achievers, and optimisers. 

For individuals, start-ups, SMEs and corporates.

# For YOU.

Standard and bespoke services, from **individual coaching** sessions to **complete programs** designed to help your personal and organisational development. **Workshops** to help get you started or over roadblocks, or deeper **consultation** on achieving business transformation.

**Change coaching.** Whether you are dealing with or driving change, having a sparring partner can make the process less painful.

**Leadership. Direction. **Communication. Motivation. Role modelling.

**Performance. ** Unlock more of your potential and manage your energy. Become a _Business Athlete_(r)_._

**Lifestyle. **Define and achieve your health and fitness goals, whether you are just beginning to adopt a healthier lifestyle, or trying to fine tune your athletic performance. Adopt _B__usiness Athlete_(r) or _Precision Nutrition_(r)

Open and in-house seminars and workshops designed to help you crystalise and achieve your goals.

I specialise in English language multicultural environments. Most programs can be offered in German on request.

Whatever challenges you have set yourself, if you need a different perspective to help you achieve change, leadership, performance or health goals, then I will be happy to hear from you.

The first consultation is free of charge with no obligations.

My background is in large company high-tech marketing having worked for an American semiconductor company for 17 years in multiple countries. I have direct experience of entrepreneurship challenges, having set up and run an internet based food business for two years. I qualified as a coach in 2014 and became a Business Athlete coach and Precision Nutrition coach in 2015\. I am an active triathlete, and love travelling by bicycle, skiing and sea swimming.

I believe firmly that nearly all individuals and organisations are inherently more capable than their achievements so far. By realising more of our potential through physical fitness, mental engagement, emotional awareness and spiritual alignment we can become as awesome as we want to be.
